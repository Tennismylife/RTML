* Dommy's R code (and some data) to perform tennis-related statistics

** Update 20190508

- This is an early stage work-in-progress; expect things to change A
  LOT in the near future, as I learn data.table and I understand which
  functionalities really matter.
- As of today we have just a bunch of R functions with no
  documentation whatsoever (DataFunctions.R), some sparsely commented
  example searches (CountTournaments.R) and a compilation of ATP matches 1968-2019
  (due credits to Topspin1985 AKA TennisMyLife and to Jeff Sackmann; license to be resolved).
- The functions should interact nicely with the data from Jeff Sackmann
